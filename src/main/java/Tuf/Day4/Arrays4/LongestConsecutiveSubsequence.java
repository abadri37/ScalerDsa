/**
 * ðŸ§© Problem: Longest Consecutive Subsequence
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest sequence
 * of consecutive elements.
 *
 * A consecutive sequence consists of numbers that follow each other with a gap of 1.
 * The elements can appear in any order in the array.
 *
 * âœ… Constraints:
 * - You must solve the problem in O(n) time.
 *
 * ðŸ“Œ Examples:
 * Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]
 *
 * Input: [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
